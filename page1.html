            We are a dedicated group of students from Sultan Qaboos University,
            passionate about leveraging technology to make learning more accessible 
            and engaging. As part of our COMP3700 - Introduction to Web Computing course, 
            we developed SkillMatch, a platform designed to connect learners with expert 
            instructors in various skills, including coding, marketing, swimming, and more.

            environment where individuals can find the right mentors to help them grow 
            and succeed. We believe in the power of personalized education and strive to 
            bridge the gap between learners and instructors through a seamless, 
            technology-driven platform.
